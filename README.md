Abstract:
---

Plenty of studies consider landslide susceptibility prediction as a binary classification problem when using machine learning methods, which requires both landslide and non-landslide samples for modelling. Nevertheless, there are only landslide and unlabeled areas in the real world, and directly considering unlabeled areas as non-landslide areas may cause bias and incorrect label assignment. In this study, we present a positive unlabeled learning method coupled with adaptive sampling (AdaPU) to predict landslide susceptibility of the Three Gorges reservoir area, China. This method can make full use of the landslide and non-landslide information contained in unlabeled areas. Moreover, the AdaPU method can avoid the problem of wrong label assignment by using the adaptive sampling strategy. Experimental results show that the AdaPU method achieves desirable predication outcomes in terms of accuracy analysis, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis. Overall, the application of positive unlabeled learning provides a new perspective for landslide susceptibility prediction, and can be recommended to predict landslide susceptibility in other areas with similar geo-environmental conditions.
